To get started with this application you must first use the Payment or Deposit options to start a record of your finances. As you continue to add more entries, the other features will begin to work better.

### Fun facts 

1. I wanted to only use two classes while making my application. It became very messy very fast and eventually ended with six.
2. In my code you can see inconsistencies with how I use this
    - (Transactions transaction : list) -
piece of code throughout my project. In the ReportScreen class I replace "transaction" with "x" becasue I got tired of reading and writing the word "transaction".
3. My project will crash if you enter a date or time incorrectly.
